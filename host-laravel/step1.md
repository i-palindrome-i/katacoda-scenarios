In this lesson, we're going to be using Laravel 7, which requires PHP >= 7.2.5 and a number of PHP extensions.

To meet this requirement, we'll install PHP 7.3. Unfortunately, this is not currently available in Ubuntu's default repositories. It is available in a Personal Package Archives (PPA) published by [Ondrej Sury](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej).

Add this repository now using `add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php`{{execute}}.
