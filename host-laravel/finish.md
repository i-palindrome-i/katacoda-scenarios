It can be overwhelming the number of components you need to get configured correctly to get your Laravel site running. (We still need to set up the database!)

If you'd prefer to worry less about these implementation details, [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) is always a great option for managing the server configuration for you.

I hope this was helpful, please let me know if you experienced any pain points or if any of the steps could be explained better.
